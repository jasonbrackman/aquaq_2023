"""
After watching approximately 15 minutes of daytime television, you're overcome with the
irresistible urge to play bingo. You decide to play alone to hide your shame at being 
seduced by ads on TV, and start with the US standard game, using the 5x5 number grid below:

6  17 34 50 68
10 21 45 53 66
5  25 36 52 69
14 30 33 54 63
15 23 41 51 62

In this game, you win when you get all the numbers in a:
 - row, 
 - column or 
 - diagonal. 
 
 So for example, if the numbers 10 5 21 45 53 70 66 4 were called, your game would be over as 
soon as 66 was called - the game is ended in 7 turns, because you are the only player.
The input attached is a list of called number sequences. What is the sum of the amount 
of numbers it takes in each row to end the game? If the above input was repeated 4 times, 
the answer would be 28.
