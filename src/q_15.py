"""
As a child, nothing is more difficult and mysterious than the game which apparently has no name, but goes like this:

You have a starting word, and an ending word - changing one letter at a time and always maintaining a real word,
make a chain of words from the start to the end. For example:
fly
...
try

Results in
fly
fry
try

This results in a chain three words long, including the starting and ending words.

Using the word list here as a list of valid words, find the shortest full chain of each word pair in the input.
The answer is the product of the lengths of each chain - so if the input was
fly,try
try,fly
word,maze

The lengths of each chain would be 3 3 5, and the product of these would be the answer: 45.
